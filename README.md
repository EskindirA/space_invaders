I wanted to learn canvas basics so I decided to make my first javascript game... with lots of explosions ;)

It's written in vanilla CoffeeScript, no frameworks were used. I did use the excellent [howler.js](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library) web audio lib though.


Compiled files are within space_shooter folder.
